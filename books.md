# Book Recommendations

## HTML / CSS

This is the one book I'd recommend on HTML/CSS. Fantastic.

* [HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites](http://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_2?ie=UTF8&refRID=0FGYNTFAWSXAY4X9E8HB)


## General Books on JS:

Both of these are excellent. I'd recommend the first over the second (it's by the
same author as the HTML/CSS book above).

* [JavaScript and JQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118531647/ref=as_li_tl?tag=httpwwwhtmlan-20)
* [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net)

## HighCharts:

I haven't read these myself, but they have good reviews and seem well-targeted.

* [Learning Highcharts](http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Highcharts-Joe-Kuan/dp/1849519080)
* [Interactive Data Visualization](http://www.amazon.com/Interactive-Data-Visualization-Scott-Murray/dp/1449339735/ref=pd_sim_14_1?ie=UTF8&dpID=516hDXg7AjL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR122%2C160_&refRID=04M6T6W281BZ52D4GRKV)

## JS Visualizations

These tend to be more advanced:

* [Beginning JavaScript Charts: With jqPlot, d3, and Highcharts](http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-JavaScript-Charts-Highcharts-Development/dp/1430262893)
* [Interactive Data Visualization for the Web](http://www.amazon.com/Interactive-Data-Visualization-Scott-Murray/dp/1449339735/ref=pd_sim_14_1?ie=UTF8&dpID=516hDXg7AjL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR122%2C160_&refRID=04M6T6W281BZ52D4GRKV)
  * this is focused on just D3, but is a good book

## Best Practices in Visualization

I **highly recommend** Tufte's books on visualization if you really want to go
deep into how to best think about, design and display data. Note that none of
these books talk about how to build charts for the web, just best practices in
design.

* [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](http://www.amazon.com/Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information/dp/0961392142/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1456247684&sr=1-1&keywords=tufte)
* [Visual Explanations: Images and Quantities, Evidence and Narrative](http://www.amazon.com/Visual-Explanations-Quantities-Evidence-Narrative/dp/0961392126/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1456247684&sr=1-4&keywords=tufte)
* [Envisioning Information](http://www.amazon.com/Envisioning-Information-Edward-R-Tufte/dp/0961392118/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1456247684&sr=1-2&keywords=tufte)
* [Beautiful Evidence](http://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Evidence-Edward-R-Tufte/dp/0961392177/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1456247684&sr=1-3&keywords=tufte)
