# JS Objects

## Learning Objectives

- Differentiate between an object and an array
- Create an object in javascript using literal notation
- Retrieve, add, and update properties from objects
- Describe common use cases for objects and arrays
- Navigate and access properties in nested data
- Iterate over an array of objects

## Intro to Objects

In JavaScript, Objects are arbitrary collections of properties; we can add or remove these properties as we please. One way to create an object is by using a curly brace notation.

```js
var car = {
  make: "Honda",
  model: "Civic",
  year: 1997
}
```

Objects are a complex data type - usually referred to as an *unordered* list (or dictionary/hash/map).
* They are a collection of key-value pairs called properties.
* The keys which we explicitly state when defining a property are analogous to our array indexes. They are how we access the associated value (more below).

### Turn and Jot: Model a Student

You're goal is to pseudo-code an object literal:

* In pairs, spend 2 minutes thinking about what attributes a student should have (think of at least 5!).
* Take 3 minutes to construct your object literal with appropriate key value pairs by drawing it on the table
* **Bonus - One key value pair contains an array**

### You DO: Interacting with Objects

**Read through the below, and then complete the exercise with your partner**

#### Create

We already saved a sample object to a `car` variable. We did this using **object literal notation**.

```js
var car = {
  make: "Honda",
  model: "Civic",
  year: 1997,

  // NOTE: Keys with a "-", or spaces, or other special characters in their name
  // must be surrounded by quotation marks.
  "tire-type": "Goodyear"
}
```

#### Read

To access object properties, we use either dot (`.property`) or bracket (`["property"]`) notation.

```js
console.log( car.make );
console.log( car["make"] );

// What happens when we try to access a property yet to be defined?
console.log( car.owner )

// NOTE: When accessing properties whose keys have a "-" in them, you must use bracket notation.
console.log( car["tire-type"] );
```

#### Update

To update an object property, we place it on the left side of an assignment statement.

```js
car.year = 2003
```

We can also create brand new properties for an object after it's initialized using this method.

```js
// Now our car has a smell property equal to "Leathery Boot". We did not initially declare this property.
car.smell = "Leathery Boot"
```

#### Iterating through an Object

Like arrays, you can use a loop to iterate through an object. Say we want to print out all of an object's keys...

```js
// Iterate through object keys
for (attribute in car) {
  console.log( attribute );
}
```
> Knowing this, how could we go about getting all the values in an object?

Javascript objects also have native methods that take care of this for us...
```js
// .keys()
Object.keys( car );
```

### Exercise

Create a variable named `dataVisStudent` and assign it to an object literal.

1. Give your student at least three properties.
2. One must have a key that contains a hyphen.
3. One must contain an array or object.
4. Update two properties, one of which is the hyphenated.
5. Give your student a new property using dot or bracket notation.
6. Delete one attribute.
7. Iterate through and print out all of the student's key-value pairs.

**Bonus:** Write a function that returns your `dataVisStudent` object

### Nested Collections

Object properties aren't limited to simple data types. We can also nest collections inside of collections.

```js
var car = {
  make: "Honda",
  model: "Civic",
  year: 1997,

  // An array within an object.
  gears: ["Reverse", "Neutral", "1", "2", "3", "4"],

  // An object within an object.
  engine: {
    horsepower: "6 horses",
    pistons: 12,
    fast: true,
    furious: false
  }
}
```

**Q** In the above examples, how do we access...
* "Neutral" (i.e., array value within an object)?
* "6 horses" (i.e., object value within an object)?
