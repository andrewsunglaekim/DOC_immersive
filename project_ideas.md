# Project Goal / Ideas

## Goal

Your goal is to build a webpage that contains at least one interactive
visualization, and shows off what you've learned in class.

That data should ideally come from an API, but if you have CSV or Excel data,
let us know and we'll try to help you use that.

## Ideas

If you have a data set you use at work (or that you're personally interested),
that's a great place to start.

If you'd prefer, here are some alternate ideas:

### Annual Survey of Manufacturers API

Build one or more of the following visualizations:

* a grouped bar chart that shows average salary per state over time
* a bar chart of average salaries per state, where the user can select the year and or states to show.
* a a scatter graph that plots one or more data points from the api against either another data point from the API or from some external data source... e.g.
  * annual salary vs state population
  * percentage employment vs region (color coded)
  * perhaps where you can change the year during which the data collected
