# Presentation Guide

## Overview

First off, since you've had < 2 days to work on your project, no one is
expecting a super polished 'product' or presentation... we'll keep them
informal.

This is your chance to show off what you've learned, and some data /
visualization(s) that are interesting to you.

## Suggested Format

We'll ask that you keep your presentation to under 10 minutes. No need for
slides, but you're welcome to use them if you'd like. Some things you might want
to cover in your presentation:

* What's your data set?
  * Where did it come from (format)?
  * Why is it meaningful?
* Show us your visualization(s)
* Walk us through a bit of your code
  * Share anything that was interesting, challenging, etc
* What would you like to keep working on with this particular project in the future?
